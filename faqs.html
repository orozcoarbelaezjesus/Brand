        <h2>What is Lorem Ipsum?</h2>
          <p>
          Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has
          been the industry’s standard dummy ext ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took
          a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five
          centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was
          popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages,
          and more ecently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of
          Lorem Ipsum.
          </p>
        <h2>Why do we use it?</h2>
          <p>
          It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page
          when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal
          distribution of letters, as opposed to using ‘Content here, content here’, making it look like
          readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem
          Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for ‘lorem ipsum’ will uncover many web sites
          still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident,
          sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
